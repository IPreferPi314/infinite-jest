# infinite-jest
Hey everybody. This is Lars. Presumably if you're reading this, you're also Lars? I'm probably the only one working on this project because it's my personal thing.
If you're reading this on the website because you know how to crawl or just looked up the readme.md file, go away. This is my development journal or smth.
If you're me, feel free to put fun little projects in here to share with your friends. Consider this your online sandbox.
